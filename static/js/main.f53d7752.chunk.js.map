The modules cover society, culture, politics, law, economy and doing business in China. However, it is inappropriate for UCD to allow a Chinese state entity to oversee teaching about Chinese politics and society. Confucius Institutes are controlled by the Chinese Language Council International.which is ultimately overseen by the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) Central Propaganda Department. Educational institutions across the United States and Australia have the same concern and appear to be reconsidering the relationship with Confucius Institutes and as of August, 37 public schools have closed down the Confucius Institutes around the world.

The number of investment is increasing with the support from IDA Ireland. I am concerned about China’s growing interest in the economy, and the security of scientific intellectual-property, which are also questioned in the US, Australia and other Euorpean countries. I am wondering how Ireland would like to do business deals with a brutal tyranny - China.</p>\n             <p>Also, according to the latest figures of the State’s Immigrant Investor Programme, more than 90 percent of applicants are from China. Earlier this year the European Parliament’s committee on financial crime and tax evasion urged members states to close down the investor immigration schemes and I believe Ireland should review the potential risks of national security, money-laundering and tax-evasion from those Chinese applicants of Immigrant Investor Programme. </p>\n             <p>On the other hand,  I would like to raise concerns about the influence of Confucius Institute - a Chinese state-backed organisation in UCD. More than 450 Confucius Institutes have been set up by the Chinese government in partnership with universities around the world. While they are sometimes compared to cultural organisations such as the British Council and France’s Alliance Française, the Chinese model is unique in being located only on university or college campuses, that UCD agreed with the Chinese government to jointly operate a Confucius Institute on the Belfield campus in 2006 until at least 2066 for 50 years!</p>\n             <p>The college has recently established a course on Chinese studies which it said “offers a wide range of modules” to help students gain an “understanding and knowledge of China”. The modules cover society, culture, politics, law, economy and doing business in China. However, it is inappropriate for UCD to allow a Chinese state entity to oversee teaching about Chinese politics and society. Confucius Institutes are controlled by the Chinese Language Council International.which is ultimately overseen by the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) Central Propaganda Department. Educational institutions across the United States and Australia have the same concern and appear to be reconsidering the relationship with Confucius Institutes and as of August, 37 public schools have closed down the Confucius Institutes around the world. Yet, why Irish government allows a Communist propaganda machine in our public university?</p>\n             <p>I hope you can review the issues for yourself just how serious the problems have become and can, subsequently, lobby some of your fellow members of the Dáil to support a change in the foreign policies regarding Ireland - China relationship.</p>\n             <p>I would be very interested in hearing from you with regards to your views on this matter and what you might be able to do about it.</p>\n             <br />\n             <p>Yours sincerely,<br />\n             [Insert your name]\n             </p>\n             <p>\n             <b>References:</b><br />\n             <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/china-has-been-buying-irish-should-we-be-worried-1.3605484\">https://www.irishtimes.com/business/china-has-been-buying-irish-should-we-be-worried-1.3605484</a> <br/>\n             <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/more-than-1-200-apply-for-immigrant-investor-programme-1.4011744\">https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/more-than-1-200-apply-for-immigrant-investor-programme-1.4011744</a><br/>\n             <a href=\"https://www.thesun.ie/news/3089303/ireland-china-citizenship-immigration/\">https://www.thesun.ie/news/3089303/ireland-china-citizenship-immigration/</a><br/>\n             <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ucd-professor-raises-concerns-about-chinese-influence-on-campus-nd30tcqvl\">https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ucd-professor-raises-concerns-about-chinese-influence-on-campus-nd30tcqvl</a><br/>\n             </p>\n         </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n    );\n  }\n \n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
